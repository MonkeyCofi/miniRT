order of transformations according to what works in our program:
	- translation
	- rotation
	- scaling

things that are broken:
	- shadows
	- cylinders
	- planes (somewhat broken. maybe???)

norminette everything
free every malloc
refactor the functions to no longer make the inverse a malloc'd function
check why lights somehow go inside a shape
cone shadow??
