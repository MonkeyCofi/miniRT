for sure:
	- change all error messages to print "Error\n" first

maybe:
	split up the mandatory and bonus parts
	requirements:
		- remove cone
		- remove parse bonus specs
		- change lighting function and struct
		- remove key hooks
		- change to non-threaded render
		- make it so that you can only have one light and that light cannot have colors
